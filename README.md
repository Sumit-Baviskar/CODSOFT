# üìÇ **Projects Overview**  üìÇ

### **1. üé¨ Audience Sentiments on Movies**  
**Description:**  
In this project, I developed a system to predict movie ratings using Python. The workflow included collecting and preprocessing data from publicly available sources, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns, and building a machine learning model to predict ratings accurately.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- Implemented **data collection** and **cleaning** techniques to handle missing and noisy data.  
- Performed **EDA** using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize relationships and uncover meaningful insights.  
- Utilized machine learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** to develop a robust predictive model.  
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  

**Skills Acquired:**  
- Hands-on experience with data preprocessing techniques (handling null values, outliers, etc.).  
- Strengthened understanding of regression models and their applications in predicting continuous variables.  
- Improved proficiency in Python libraries such as **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation.

### **3. üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
**Description:**  
This project focused on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It involved handling a highly imbalanced dataset, preprocessing data effectively, and implementing logistic regression for classification.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- Addressed **class imbalance** using techniques like **oversampling** (SMOTE) and **undersampling** to improve model performance.  
- Performed thorough **EDA** to identify patterns distinguishing fraudulent from legitimate transactions.  
- Built classification models using **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest** to optimize detection accuracy.  
- Evaluated models using performance metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**.  

**Skills Acquired:**  
- In-depth understanding of handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning.  
- Strengthened ability to select appropriate classification algorithms for fraud detection tasks.  
- Improved familiarity with evaluation metrics specific to classification problems.
